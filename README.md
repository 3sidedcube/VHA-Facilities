# VHA-Facilities
The facility file includes all VA facilities, not just those related to health care.  The source of this JSON file is the database supporting the Web pages http://vaww.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp.  VA staff throughout the United States update content through a portal inside of VA.  Hundreds of VA employees are involved with maintaining the contenet.  Any feedback about data quality issues, which we need, will be redirected to the specific staff who have "write" authority for that content and they will make the updates once it is approved.  There is no easy way to incorporate an enhanced JSON file back to the source system which is likely a relational database.  The Web API used to build the JSON file is referenced inside of the JSON file near the beginning of the content.
